# Disaggregation-of-energy-consumption

//Specifications

Energy is a scarce commodity whose economic issues are at the heart of concerns. However, consumers continue to receive big bills at the end of the month and wonder which devices are consuming so much: wasteful situation. If they can understand the consumption of each device and regulate their use, they will save up to 30% on their bills. Machine Learning and NILM techniques make it possible to identify the consumption of each device from a single general consumption curve of the entire building: this is the breakdown of energy.

//Prerequisites

1- Preparation of a device signature dataset
2- Creation of a disaggregation program
